# A Retail Analysis
### Capstone Project – Ikram

#### Description

For this project, I looked at customer transactions between 2009-12-01 to 2010-12-09. This data is useful for creating a marketing strategy and better understanding customer behaviour. My goal was to identify the types of customers and create a model predicting the daily number of orders.


#### Results
Customers were divided into 3 groups based on revenue, number of orders, average time between orders, and whether they were registered customers or not.

| Cluster            | 0         |  1        | 2         |
| :---               |   :----:  |   :----:  |      ---: |
| Name               | Regular   | One-off   | Unloyal   |
| Number of customers| 2741      | 1656      | 1544      |
| Number of orders   | 6.3       | 1         | 1.1       |
| Yearly spend       | £2938     | £703      | £381      |
| Revenue (%)        | 82.12%    | 11.88%    | 6%        |
